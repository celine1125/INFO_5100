<p id = "p1">Identify which of the following are valid Javascript types
  (i.e. can be returned as output from the typeof() function).
  For each valid type provide an example using console.log(typeof( ... )).
  (30 pts)
  <script>
  //boolean is valid Javascript type.
  var x = false;
  console.log(typeof(x));

  //double, float are not valid Javascript types.

  //function is a valid Javascript type.
  function mul(x, y) {

  };
  console.log(typeof(mul));

  //int, list and map are not valid Javascript types.

  //number is a valid Javascript type.
  var a = 1;
  console.log(typeof(a));

  //object is  a valid Javascript type.
  var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  console.log(typeof(list));

  //regex is not a valid Javascript type.

  //string is a valid Javascript type.
  var s = 'dsafasdf';

  //tuple is not a valid Javascript type.

  //undefined is a valid Javascript type.

<p id = "p2"> Each of the following expressions contains improper JSON:
  calling JSON.parse(...) will result in an error. For each example,
  describe the error and provide a fixed version. Use the JSON.parse
  function to demonstrate that it works. Some may contain more than one error.

  <script>
  //a. { name: "Data-driven web applications" }
  //name should be included in a double quotation mark.

  //b. { /* the next variable is a course number */ "number": 3300 }
  //Comment can not be included in JSON directly, it need to be convert to a String.
  JSON.parse('{ "comment":"/* the next variable is a course number */", "number": 3300 }');

  //c. [ { "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 } { "name": "Java",
  //"number": 2110 } { "name": "Python", "number"; 1110 }
  //First, it lacks a ']' in the end.
  //Second, different objects should be seperated by ','.
  //Third, in the last objects, behind the "number" should be a ':' rather than a ';'

<p id = "p3"> 3 . Write a JSON expression that represents a list. This list should
  contain at least three objects. Each object should have at least three properties.
  The value of one property should be a number, the value of another should be a
  boolean, and value of a third should be a list of strings. You may define the
  contents in any way you choose and add additional properties as long as we can
  easily verify that the required elements are present. (30 pts)
