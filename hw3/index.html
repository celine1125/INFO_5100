<p id = "p1">1. Create a 200x200 pixel SVG element with the word "Cornell" in red,
  centered in the exact middle (vertically and horizontally), using the Palatino
  typeface, with a drop shadow for the word. Consult the SVG specification to find
  out how to change color and font attributes, set text alignment, and add filters
  and shadows. Put a small orange circle at 100,100 so we can see that your text
  is centered. If you do not have Palatino, you may use another font to test your
  code. (20pts)</p>

<p id = "p2">2. Create a 200x200 pixel SVG element. Reproduce the plot in Figure
  2 of the Wickham "Layered Grammar of Graphics" reading using SVG elements.
  Recalculate the pixel positions for the (x, y) coordinates in Table 2 as
  necessary. Remember to account for the "padding" pixels below and to the left
  of the axes. Include axis labels. You do NOT need to include the short tick marks.
  Table 2 contains data values. Table 3 contains those data values transformed
  into pixel coordinates. You will need to recalculate these pixel coordinates.
  The result will not look exactly like Figure 2; we will know what to expect for
  the data in Table 2. Points intersecting axes are ok. (20pts)</p>

<p id = "p3">3. Use SVG <path> elements to create a design for the course flag.
  You must include three enneagrams and position them using the transform attribute.
  You may use any additional shapes or patterns you can think of as long as you
  implement them using <path> elements. If you use a tool to generate coordinates
  for shapes, please cite that tool. You must also include the course motto:
  ESSE ETVIDERI using a <text> element. Hint: for repeated shapes, write the
  coordinates once, copy it several times, and then use some combination of
  translate() and scale() transformations to place them. There will be a small
  creativity component in grading. (20pts)</p>

  <p id = "p4">4. Make a bar plot that represents the frequency of numbers in
    this dataset: var samples = [4, 1, 7, 3, 15, 10, 0, 10, 8, 4, 4, 2, 15, 6, 7, 6];
    The x-axis will correspond to values from the dataset, and the y-axis will
    correspond to the frequency of those values. Figure out how to map those
    numbers into pixel coordinates. Consider the following dataset:
    A. Make a bar plot of the data values using SVG rectangles. Create one
    rectangle for each distinct integer in the dataset. Each one should be
    positioned so that it is centered at the x-axis value that corresponds to
    its data value. For example, the middle of the bar for "3" should be at the
    pixel coordinate that corresponds to the value 3. In other words, leave empty
    space even for values that have no observations: there should be a gap between
    the bars for 8 and 10. (20pts)
    B. Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation and record those
    numbers in the <p> tag. You may use whatever tool you like, we only need to
    see the result. (5 pts)
    C. Add vertical lines to the plot corresponding to the mean (in red), median
    (in blue) and mode (in purple). For the "mean" line, make a line from the top
    of the figure to the bottom, at the x position in the figure that corresponds
    to the mean you calculated. (5 pts)
    D. Use an SVG rectangle with a semi-transparent fill to show the region
    covering one standard deviation on both sides of the mean. In other words,
    make a rectangle from the top of the figure to the bottom that is centered
    at the mean, and two standard deviations wide. (5pts)
    E. Calculate the probability that a randomly selected datapoint is greater
    than or equal to 4 and record it in the <p> tag. (5pts)</p>

    <p>mean = 6.375, median = 6, mode = 4, standard deviation = 4.440, probability = 0.75</p>
